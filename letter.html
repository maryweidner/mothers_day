              Since I couldn't see you in person this year,I thought this would be a good opportunity to send you an e-card, made from scratch, with love, by me! I've been following an online course, trying to develop some technical skills, so I thought this would be a good side project to practice a bit more. Hopefully it renders right on your device. *fingers crossed*. 
                <br><br>
              Anyway, I hope your mother's day has been a good one because you deserve it! Thank you for everything you've done for me in life. I'm perpetually thankful for you! 
                <br><br>
              Enjoy some of this nice weather and I'll see you soon to celebrate in person &#9829;
                <br><br>
              Love,
                <br><br>
